👋 Hi, I’m @Lyilma140
 👀
-Here is a link to the dataset I am currently using <- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset
 🌱
- The dataset I am currently using consists of a patient's medical and demographic information as well
  as their diabetes status. Age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history,
  HbA1c level, and blood sugar level are among the characteristics of the data. These charcteristics are suppose
  to explore the various relationships between different medical and
  demographic data and also predict the liklihood of someone getting diabetes.

- 💞️ The purpose of this repository is to gain skills in data science and using R, and also to gain a better understanding of how data is collected and reasearched.
